# Web-Server-Monitoring

The client will be connected to the server, and when the client attempts to access a website, the request will be first received by the server. The server will then check whether the website is permitted based on the predefined criteria. If the website is permitted, the server will send the website data to the client. However, if the website is not permitted, the server will block the access request, and the client will not be able to access the website. The project will require the development of both the server and client applications, with the server-side code implementing the logic for website access restrictions. The client-side code will be responsible for sending access requests to the server and handling the response. The project will likely require the use of network protocols such as HTTP and TCP/IP, as well as programming languages such as Python, Java, or C++.
